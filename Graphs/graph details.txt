Types of Graph
1. Undirected Graph
2. Directed Graph
3. Weighted Graph
4. Cyclic Graph
5. Acyclic Graph

Degree:
	The number of edges of the graph is called degree.
	In directed graph degree is two types
	1. In Degree (Number of incoming edges)
	2. Out Degree (Number of outgoing edges)

Path:
	its the way to going from one vertex to another without repeating any vertex.

Graph Represantation:
	1. Adjacency Matrix
	2. Adjacency List

	Matrix:
		to represent an eged between two vertex(u, v) we store value of the matrix[u][v] = 1, and all the other position of the matrix have a value of 0.
		SC : O(N^2) N = Number of vertex.
	List:
		we take a array of list/vector in that we store value of all the vertex can be reached from a particular vertex.
		SC : O(N + 2*E) N = Vertex, E = NUmber of Edges.

Traversal Technique:
	BFS(Breadth First Search)
	DFS(Depth First Search)
